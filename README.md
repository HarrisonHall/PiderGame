## PiderGame
Physics sim game using automated piders. 

This is a personal project I'll be working on for the next few years. 

Update 4.

**Dev Plan**

1. Add color to piders
2. Add animations to ship
3. Add new tiles to tilemap (along with functionality)
4. Create 10 levels
  * Keep in debug levels
5. Levelmap

* World1 menu



#Nice#

**The rest are doodles while I learn github**

'''Python
pider5 = piderEngine.pider("0,true,motor.on")

print("Cool yo")

'This' is in code.
